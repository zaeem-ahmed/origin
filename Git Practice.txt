* Vcs runs as independent it let u work on any surface, any editor and etc.

* Storing Versions: u dont need to create backups everytime when it comes to changes and u want to move on to the last action u performed then VCS provide 
you these benefit bcz it continiously taking ur snapshots so in vcs u r working on only the one working directory then if u need to go back so u easily went 
back without backups by using last snapsjots.

* git-scm.com(to download git)

* syntevo.com(to download smart git)

* write "git" on cmd to verify rather git downloaded or not.

* to enter the name and email in git u use the following commands:
for name: git config --global user.name "Your Name"
for email: git config --global user.email "Your Email"

* Staging Area: where u decide how much files would u like to send in staging area and from there how much you want commit to the next area called local repository.

* After commiting, your history of filesystem started to record.
1. Git Operations:-
i) git add (ur files went to the staging area or how much would u like to send in proceding process)
ii) git commit (after running this your record of history started to create or after commit ur data continiously recorded at permanent basis)
iii) git push (to send the data on your server)
iv) git pull (to receive data from server)
v) git checkout (to move any branch on your local repo or want to some changes locally)
vi) git merge (it will integrate your whole filesystem or branches into a single one)

* Important Terms:
1. Repository (it works like a database, all your history of filesystem such as all versions,snapshots,metadata,commits shortly whole project save in it and 
it is a hidden folder named ".git" in the root directory of your project.
2. Working Directory (the root folder of your project which contains your project's files)
3. Files status Lifecycle (over to pic)
4. Staging Area (A virtual place that collects all the files u want to include in next commit)

* Head (represents the last commit)

* Commit Hash (every commit has a unique identifier, a 40 character checksum)

* Ignoring Files (if u dont want to create any history of any particular file so u can ignore in it by making an empty document named as ".gitignore" where u 
mentioned the extension or name of file which u want to ignore)

* Stash (a clipboard in git which provides you the facility to keep saving your changes temporarily)

* Short lived Branches (they are temporary branches use to do a short purpose like bug fixes, features etc and when the work done they removed)

* Long Lived Branches (they are permanent branches use to do a long live work like development, production and etc and not to be deleted)

* Remote Repositories (A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is 
stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server)(Server) 

* GitHub (Github is online service for git to create remote repositories on github's server and collabrate with team mates)(Actually it is a online servive 
provided by github which work for u as a Server)

* When we create remote repositories in Github it create a commit with read me file.

* Git Workflow (these is not the feature of git, these feature is provided by Github)

* Pull Request: You create it if u want to review your code by your any teamate, team leader or manager so you can finally merge it into your production branch. 

* Forking (A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea 
and at last when u want to submit your work to the original repo or author u create a pull request then it depends on him either he accepts it or not)
(these is not the feature of git, these feature is provided by Github)

* You can't delete the current or working branch in git directly, you are supposed to checkout to the other branch to del that branch.

* Git Revert (actually it doesn't delete a commit, it just create another commit with reverting process)

* Git Merge Command (There are 2 possibilities using these command for merging, i) Fast Forward    ii) Merge Commmit)
i) Fast Forward (when any other branch has a differ commit and u want to merge it into another and that hasn't any commit)
ii) Merge Commit (when both branches has some differ commits and u want to merge both of them) (additional commit will create in parent branch and in that commit u 
have the record of different commits of different branch or u can say these commit lead both branches at the same time)

* Git Rebase (your all commits of different branch show in a single straight line just to give the look as your all commit performed in a single branch)
